## ðŸ§ª Formula-based Regression Benchmarking with Synthetic and Real Data

This project benchmarks various mathematical or machine learning formulas by training individual regression models using synthetic or real datasets. The objective is to measure how well different formulas can be modeled using a feedforward neural network (FNN).

---

### ðŸ“Œ Features

- Automatically loads a real dataset (`formula_dataset.csv`) if available.
- If not, generates synthetic data for each formula.
- Trains a neural network regression model for each formula.
- Evaluates and reports **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for each model.
- Identifies the best-performing formula based on MSE.

### ðŸ§  Formulas Supported

Includes 30 formulas from reinforcement learning, information retrieval, NLP, and hybrid methods:
